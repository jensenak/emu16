Emu16 is just a simple 16 bit processor emulator. 

Really just a fun project to experiment with processor "architecture". There are interfaces defined for each of the resources used by the processor: Memory, Bootmedia, and Busses. The current example implementation uses a busses for raw and ascii tty output (thus enabling the output "Hello, World!"). 

I really am not a huge fan of "Hello, World!" but based on the amount of work it would take to write a more complex program, I thought that would be a decent demonstration. :)
